# skr_klipper_printer_cfg
printer cfg for ender 3 with skr mini e3 v2.0 with bltouch used as z stop Speed Drive direct drive adaptor, and 40mm fang cooling duct (you'll need to change offsets or run the bits i'm running to make use of this)

for my specific printer, but should be a good base to start from.

direct drive i'm using: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3816051

fan duct: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4630748

you'll want to conduct your own calibrations for resonance compensation, pressure advance, pid tuning and the like, but this should be p close.
